```

### Notable Features
- Header underline animates from center-out on active items.
- Mobile menu overlay with backdrop, close controls, search, and CTA.
- Footer categories collapse/expand on small screens; always open on large.
- Articles carousel shows peeks on mobile, multiple cards on desktop.
- Contact form validates required fields and email; shows success message.

### Configuration
- Redirects: configured in `next.config.ts` (e.g., `/landing-page` -> `/`).
- Fonts: Google Montserrat loaded in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

### Development Notes
- Components that use hooks or browser APIs are marked as client components via "use client".
- Tailwind classes prefer semantic variables defined in `globals.css`.
- Keep new UI consistent with existing spacing, radii, and color tokens.

### Deployment
Build with `npm run build` and start with `npm start`. Suitable for deployment on Vercel or any Node.js host that supports Next.js 15.
